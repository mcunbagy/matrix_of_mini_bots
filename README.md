# matrix_of_mini_bots



DESCRIPTION

  This project is about multiple tiny robots. They are to be followed by a camera
placed well above to see each MiniBot.

  MiniBots will move around their area, so called their MATRIX.
  Each MiniBot has a duty-task to accomplish, such as going to checkpoints appointed for them.
  Also, they can recharge themselves in the ATP stations.
  
  The camera at the top - BIG BROTHER CAM - follows the positions and arranges the motion paths of each MiniBot.
  
  They are destined to do certain tasks, however, on their road they face with unexpected obstacles, or distractions...
  
  
  Although the results of their actions are defined, will they develop a freewill one day?
